# Slack Bot Extra Credit

### Author

### What I did
I integrated a custom Bots app inside of Slack. It will respond to hi and other commands found by typing `help` to the bot. These include showing a link to the bot's favorite song, dueling, and more! It also has Yelp API capabilities to help you find the best food nearby. The bot can carry a conversation and send back stuff as Slack attachments. Old-town-bot now resides on the #bots channel with an outgoing webhook to wake it up with `old-town-bot` if it is ever needed.

### Screencaps
They are under `screencaps` folder :)
